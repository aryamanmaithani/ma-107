# MA 107
Collection of Notes, Assignments and Tests

### [Notes.pdf](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-107/blob/master/Notes.pdf)
This is the file that contains the notes.  
I had made the notes until the 17th lecture, after which I got involved in another project and did not have time for this.  
This also contains Assignments 1-5, placed at the appropriate locations.  
In case you find an error at some point, you may point it to me by mailing me at [aryamanmaithani@gmail.com](mailto:aryamanmaithani@gmail.com).

### [Assignments - PDF](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-107/tree/master/Assignments%20-%20PDF)
This contains eleven (11) files in total.  
It has individual PDFs of all the ten (10) assignments that we were given. (Including the 5 contained in Notes.pdf)  
The last file is the PDF containing all the assignments together.

### [Tests - PDF](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-107/tree/master/Tests%20-%20PDF)
This contains the PDFs of the questions papers of the four (4) quizzes, midsems, and endsems.

For most of you, the above is all that you'll require.  
For those of you interested in LaTeX, here's a description of the rest -

### [Notes - LaTeX](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-107/tree/master/Notes%20-%20LaTeX)
This folder contains the source files of all the notes (and the five assignments) which are named as LecXY.tex (and AssignXY.tex).  
In addition to these, there's a file named ''main.tex'', this is the file that is to be compiled.  
As you'll see, I've used the ```\input``` command to include the lecture files. This was done to have a cleaner source code.  
This also means that you cannot compile the lecture (and assignment) files independently as they don't have the required declarations.

### [Assignments - LaTeX](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-107/tree/master/Assignments%20-%20LaTeX), [Tests - LaTeX](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/ma-107/tree/master/Tests%20-%20LaTeX)
Pretty much the same stuff as above applies here.
